## Progress updates:

Week 9 Progress:

-We finally perfected the sticky-note placement on the wall (there were still a few minor bugs left).

-We almost fully transitioned out of the blocky prototype phase.

-We added a night-time skybox.

We focused on increasing immersion and conveying the feeling of a concentrated, dedicated space for studying.

<br>
<br>

 Week 10 Progress:

-We made progress on writing on the board (it’s not perfect yet, but we’re getting very close).

-We added new songs to the radio.

-With the left hand, you can change the radio track.

-With the right hand, you can pause or play the current song.

<br>
<br>

 Week 11 Progress:

-We repaired a small bug about the radio.

-We started to implement out connection line between sticky notes.

<br>


Week 12 + holidays Progress:

-We refined the lines between sticky notes.

-Now the connection between sticky notes works without grab.

-We added candles that when you grab they light up or shut off (they include smoke and sounds).

-We made research on how lighting affects the mindset of someone who's trying to study.

-The light source in the project changes it's colour based on the time of the day IRL. (warmer colors at night and colder ones in the morning)

-We fixed a small bug with the corkscrew board (the collider was tricky so we made it a mesh collider convex).

-We made a button that screenshots the writing on the whiteboard.

-We made it that every screenshot goes in a folder that gets created on the user desktop

-We tried to follow 3 youtube tutorials about drawing on the whiteboard, still didn't help.
